# Day 01: Introduction to C Programming

Welcome to Day 01 of our C/C++ learning journey! Today, we'll embark on the fundamentals of C programming.

## Topics Covered:

### Introduction to Programming:

- Understanding the essence and historical significance of the C programming language.

### Setting Up Your Environment:

- Installation of a C compiler (e.g., MinGW for Windows, GCC for Unix-based systems).
- Configuring your development environment.

### Your First C Program:

- Writing a simple "Hello, World!" program in C.
- Grasping the basic structure of a C program, including the `main` function, syntax, and semicolons.

### Variables and Data Types:

- Introduction to variables and their types (integers, floating-point numbers, characters).
- Declaring variables, assigning values, and understanding data types.

### Basic Input and Output:

- Using `printf` for output and `scanf` for input.
- Formatting output and reading input from the user.

## Hands-On Exercise:

Write a program that takes user input (such as their name) and displays a personalized greeting message.

By the end of Day 01, you'll have a solid grasp of the fundamentals of C programming. Your development environment will be set up, and you'll have written your first C program. Get ready to delve deeper into the world of C/C++ programming in the upcoming days!
